jaumemk's dotfiles
==================

These are my first `dotfiles` public version.

* `bspwm` (as a window manager)
* `sxhkd` (hotkey daemon)
* `rofi` (launcher)
* `urxvt` (terminal)
* `feh` (for backgrounds)
* `Hack` (font face)

__Special features__
1. Detects if external monitor is plugged in and switches to it (xrandr).
2. Super mouse. (32 pixel, easier to find in high resolution small screens).

__About__
These `dotfiles` are tested on Arch, bu may work fine in other distros. Focused to my X260 laptop.

To-do
-----
* Panel (maybe lemonbar)
* Visual feedback improvements
* Notify area
* Hack Arc Theme Red to be darker. https://github.com/mclmza/arc-theme-Red/releases/download/1/Arc-Red-theme.zip
